Document Scanner using Computer Vision
Overview
This project is a document scanner that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and extract text or important information from images of documents. It can be useful for digitizing physical documents, extracting text for further processing, or archiving important information.

Features
Image Capture: Capture images of documents using a camera or input images from the file system.

Document Detection: Use computer vision algorithms to detect and identify documents within the images.

Text Extraction: Extract text content from the detected documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.

Image Enhancement: Apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality of captured images for better document detection and text extraction.
